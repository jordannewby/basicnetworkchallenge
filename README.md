# basicnetworkchallenge
I set out to complete a networking challenge, and here's the outcome. You can download the packet tracer file using the link below. Might have to ping a couple of times for the routing tables to populate. Let me know what you think.

Parameters:
Using Packet Tracer, configure the following:
5 Routers. A, B, C, D, & E. Connected in sequence.
3 Switches. 1 each connected to routers A, C, & E.
6 PC's. Two PC's connected to each switch.
The networks with the PC's connected have the following network addresses:
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.2.0/24
172.16.0.0/16
The networks between the routers have the following network addresses:
A: 10.10.0.0/24
B: 10.20.0.0/24
C: 10.30.0.0/24
D: 10.40.0.0/24
The PC's on all 3 local networks should have the network and routing configured so that they can all ping each other.
